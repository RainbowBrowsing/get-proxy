An extension that will allow you to get **HTTPS-proxy** from freely hosted sheets. <!-- **[Proxy List](https://github.com/jetkai/proxy-list) and [Proxy List](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-list)**. -->

The extension will allow you to change your address or get to a site blocked in your country.

**WARNING!** We are not responsible for the security of these **Proxies** (your information that you pass through these Proxies) or for actions taken using this extension.

We do not recommend sharing sensitive information (passwords, logins, credit card details and any other information) while you are using **Proxy**. Also, if the Proxy is not working, it is better to request a new one.
